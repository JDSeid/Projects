Architecture:

Our files are grouped such that functions that do the inverse operations are
put together.

Conversion.c
Handles conversions between RGB pixels and video pixels.

Quantization.c
Handles the conversions between pb, pr, and y to avg pb, avg pr, a, b, c, and d.
Handles quantization and unquantization of these values

Packing.c
Handles the unpacking, packing and printing of values into 32 bit words

compress40.c
Reads in from the command the line or stdin. Acts a second driver file which
calls the compression and decompression functions.



What has been correctly implemented:

Our program is able to successfully compress and decompress a ppm image.
When comparing the original image to an image that has been compressed and
decompressed, ppmdiff outputs a very low difference rate (< 2%).
