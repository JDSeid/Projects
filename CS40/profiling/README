Time spent in our program
    One hot spot in our program that takes up a lot of the routine that 
    retrieves, un-bitpacks, and runs the commands. Looking at the assembly code,
    this routine fetches and stores global variables, such as the counter and
    a pointer to segment0 multiple times. It would be faster to somehow store
    these variables each in their own register, and access and change the value
    in the register, rather than fetching them from their global address each 
    time.
    
    Another hot spot in our program is Seq_get. We call this function often and
    it takes about 22.34% of our program time. One way we could modify assembly
    code to make this proccess faster would be to modify the Hanson
    implementation of Seq_get. In the Hanson implementation, there are
    assertions that check whether the parameters and sequence are valid. By
    removing these assertions, we would speed up the program. They aren't
    necessary in our um functionality because user error could result in a
    failure mode and does not need to be handled with an assertion.
