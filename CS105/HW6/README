I didn't collaborate with anyone.



Problems solved

I solved all problems on the homework:

- mynull
- reverse
- minlist
- zip
- pairfoldrEq
- concat
- numersSx
- flattenSyms
- improving closures



Improvement

Here are the  runtimes I obtained used the provided scripts:

mlscheme:  5.04s
mlscheme-improved: 1.39s
uscheme-C-interpreter: 24.95

By improving the method in which closures are captured, my implementation run
in only 28% of the time as the original implementation, and less than 5% of the
 time as the inefficient C interpreter
